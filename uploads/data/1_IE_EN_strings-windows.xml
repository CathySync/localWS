Such feedback will be in a manner convenient to Licensee and will be subject to reasonable availability of Licensee's personnel. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to Licensee disclosing to Synchronoss any information in connection with this Agreement which Licensee considers proprietary or confidential, Licensee shall obtain Synchronoss' prior written approval to disclose such information to Synchronoss, and without such prior written approval from Synchronoss, Licensee shall not disclose any such information to Synchronoss. Feedback, suggestions, ideas and other information which is provided by Licensee to Synchronoss in connection with the Software or this Agreement will become the property of Synchronoss and may be used by Synchronoss to improve or enhance its products and, accordingly, Synchronoss shall have a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide right and license to use, reproduce, disclose, sublicense, distribute, modify, and otherwise exploit such feedback, suggestions, ideas and information without restriction.

The rights and obligations of the parties set forth in Sections 2(b) 2(c), 2(d), 2(e), , 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason.

"Confidential Information" shall mean all trade secrets, know-how, inventions, techniques, processes, algorithms, software programs, hardware, schematics, and software source documents relating to the Software, and other information provided by Synchronoss, whether disclosed orally, in writing, or by examination or inspection, other than information which Licensee can demonstrate (i) was already known to Licensee, other than under an obligation of confidentiality, at the time of disclosure; (ii) was generally available in the public domain at the time of disclosure to Licensee; (iii) became generally available in the public domain after disclosure other than through any act or omission of Licensee; (iv) was subsequently lawfully disclosed to Licensee by a third party without any obligation of confidentiality; or (v) was independently developed by Licensee without use of or reference to any information or materials disclosed by Synchronoss or its suppliers. Confidential Information shall include without limitation the Software, Documentation, Performance Data, and any Updates. Licensee shall not use any Confidential Information for any purpose other than as expressly authorized under this Agreement.

Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
